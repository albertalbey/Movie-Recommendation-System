# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is intended to showcase my python skills

The csv files are movie ratings by different users. The code shows how to make movie recommendation for a particular user based on Pearson correlation and Euclidean distance from the most similar ratings from other users 

To work with this program just use the csv files change to appropriate paths and enter a name of the user from the csv files to get the recommended movies list
